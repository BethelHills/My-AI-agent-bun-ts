# Code Review

## Changes in `index.ts`

### Review:
*   **Imports:** The new imports for `generateCommitMessageTool` and `writeMarkdownFileTool` are correctly added.
*   **Tool Registration:** The new tools are properly registered within the `streamText` function's `tools` object.
*   **Prompt Update:** The prompt has been updated to reflect the new capabilities, which is good for guiding the agent.

## Changes in `tools.ts`

### Review:
*   **File System Imports:** The necessary `fs` and `path` imports are present.
*   **Zod Schemas and Types:** `commitMessage` and `markdownOutput` schemas are well-defined, capturing the required arguments for the new tools. The corresponding TypeScript types (`CommitMessage`, `MarkdownOutput`) are also correctly inferred.
*   **`generateCommitMessage` function:**
    *   **Conventional Commit Structure:** The function correctly implements a conventional commit message structure including an emoji, type, and a short description.
    *   **Emoji Mapping:** The `commitTypes` object provides a clear mapping of commit types to relevant emojis, enhancing readability.
    *   **Timestamp:** Including a timestamp in the `fullMessage` is a good practice for traceability.
    *   **Short Description:** The truncation logic for `shortDescription` is practical for concise commit summaries.
*   **`writeMarkdownFile` function:**
    *   **Directory Handling:** The function correctly handles both specified directories and defaults to the current working directory.
    *   **Directory Creation:** The `mkdirSync(targetDir, { recursive: true })` ensures that the target directory exists before writing, preventing errors.
    *   **File Extension:** The logic to ensure the filename ends with `.md` is a thoughtful detail, making the tool more robust.
    *   **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block provides basic error handling, which is important for production-ready code.
*   **Tool Exports:** The new tools `generateCommitMessageTool` and `writeMarkdownFileTool` are correctly exported.

### Suggestions:
*   **Error Handling in `getFileChangesInDirectory`:** While not part of these specific changes, it might be beneficial to add more robust error handling to `getFileChangesInDirectory` in `tools.ts` to gracefully manage scenarios where `simpleGit` operations might fail (e.g., not a git repository, network issues for remote repos, etc.). This is a general improvement, not directly related to the current diff.
*   **`generateCommitMessage` - Custom Emojis/Templates:** For more advanced use cases, consider allowing a configurable set of emojis or even a custom template for commit messages. This could be passed as an optional parameter to the tool.

## Overall Impression:

The changes introduce two valuable tools: `generateCommitMessageTool` and `writeMarkdownFileTool`. Both are well-implemented, with good attention to detail like input validation (via Zod), directory handling, and basic error management. The `generateCommitMessage` function adheres to conventional commit standards, and the `writeMarkdownFile` function is robust for its purpose. The `index.ts` updates correctly integrate these new tools into the agent's capabilities.
